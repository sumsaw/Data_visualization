Ford Go Bike System Data 

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area


## Summary of Findings
Number of users increased drastically from 2017 to 2018 
The Data set have member birth years going back to 1880 which is impracticable and was correct to inlcude values 1930 and above 
More men and female 
More Subscriber than customer
Most rides are 3000 seconds or fewer
In start_ station_id vs mean duration plot I see station id above 300 showing higher mean time 
In end station_id vs mean duration plot I see that station id between 335-350 show a much higher mean time 
Bike ride increase in spring and reached a max in summer in the year 2018 
One bike id ~4500 has higher usage . This could be a outlier or co-incidence. Also there are few bikes between 4500-5600   which have higher usage than average.
Roud trip has a higer trip duration than a single trip 
Customer ride more on average than subscribers 
Women ride more than men on average
Most rides start and end between station id 3-120 with maximum between 0-40 station ids
We see that women ride higher in all the four day zones with maximum difference in ride times in afternoon and least in the night
We see that among men almost all age zones have close average ride times 
Retired females have the highest average ride times followed by mid professional females 
We see that customer is driving on average higher than subsciber  in all sexes 
Using the month split we see that only during march and september months male ride time is greater on average than the female ride times
## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.

My main main here was to see how other parameters influence ride duration time as higher ride time means more revenue for the company . With my exploratory analysis i was 
able to identify key insights which can help the company plan its operations. 

1.I see that even though female subscribes are less they have higher mean ride duration which mean female usually use the service for longer drives.
Hence we should be looking to increasing our female customer base . 

2.Most rides are taken between station id 0-120 and even among them 0-40 station ids have the highest concentration of the rides . The company must make sure to maximize this routes 
and also make sure that people already using this routes are not caused any trouble . 

3.People using bikes for round trips have higher ride duration . The company can encourage round trips by offerening one free ride per 5 round trip this can cause some customers to 
plan round trip using the same bikes without docking them or making the rate per hour small as trip progesses . 

4. Also people starting from  and ending to station ids 300 and above tend to have a higher ride duration time 

5. We see that more rides are done during summer months and demand is less during winter months ( Nov- Jan) for the year 2018
